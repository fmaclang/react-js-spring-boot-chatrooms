# react-js-spring-boot-chatrooms
Chatrooms implemented using React JS and Spring Boot WebSocket based 
off of https://github.com/ddycai/spring-boot-chatrooms, https://github.com/DHARESHWAR/websocket-reactjs, 
and https://github.com/DHARESHWAR/spring-chat-application

This project was created as a result of trying to implement SpringBoot WebSocket with React JS, specifically
chat room functionality with the option of multiple rooms through the use of "rooms"
